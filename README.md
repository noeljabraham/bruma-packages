# Bruma Linux

**Bruma Linux** is a Debian-based Linux distribution built on **Debian Testing**.  
The goal of Bruma is to provide a clean, modern, and customizable desktop experience while learning and experimenting with Linux distribution development.

## About the Project

Bruma Linux is currently an **independent learning project**.  
It focuses on understanding:

- Linux system structure
- Package building
- ISO creation with live-build
- Desktop environment customization
- Branding and theming
- Repository management

This project is not intended to replace Debian, but to build on top of it and explore how Linux distributions are created and customized.

## Desktop Environments

### GNOME (Primary Focus)
The **GNOME edition** is the main version of Bruma Linux.

- Most features, branding, wallpapers, and configuration changes are implemented here.
- Active development and experimentation happen in this version.

### KDE (Secondary)
A **KDE edition** is also available, but it currently receives fewer updates.  
Some changes may not yet be applied to the KDE version.

## Current Status

- Debian Testing base
- Custom wallpapers and branding
- GNOME-focused configuration
- KDE files included but not fully customized
- Learning and evolving continuously

Mistakes may exist, and improvements are always welcome.  
This project is part of a learning journey, and feedback is appreciated.
